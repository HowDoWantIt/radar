# Radar Simulator by IDC

This is a modular and extensible radar simulator developed by **IDC**, implemented entirely in Python.  
It is designed for simulation of radar pulses, moving targets, and signal detection in a customizable environment.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“¡ Simulates radar pulses and echo returns
- ðŸŽ¯ Models moving targets with position and velocity
- ðŸ”Š Adds noise and detection thresholds to signals
- ðŸ§­ Real-time radar display with target detection visualization
- ðŸ§© Fully modular structure (easy to extend)
